Economic modeling is about playing god. 

You have the power to produce a consumer,

Whose happiness is solely depend on a function, called **utility function**:
```{r}
bundle <- setNames(vector("numeric",2), c("X","Y"))
utility <- function(bundle){
  prod(bundle**c(0.3, 0.8))
}
utility(bundle)
```

Whose resource is limited, confined by **budget constraint**:
```{r}
budget_constraint <- 
  list(
    Prices = setNames(vector("list", length(bundle)), names(bundle)),
    Income = 0
  )

budget_constraint$Prices$X=10
budget_constraint$Prices$Y=5
budget_constraint$Income=2000
```


You give it existence:
```{r}
consumer <- Consumer(utility, budget_constraint)
consumer$budget_constraint

```
